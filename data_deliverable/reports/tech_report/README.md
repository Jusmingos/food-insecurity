# Tech Report

There are # data points in the dataset. This should be enough data to train a model that can predict metrics of a crop in a given country for a given year in our analysis.

## Data Description
The identifying attributes are `Country`, `Crop`, and `Year`. These are the attributes that we will use to group our data by. We will use these attributes to analyze the data by country, crop, and year, and their respective yields, area harvested, and production. These give 
us a concrete idea of food security in a given country, and how it has changed over time.

## Data Sources
The three data sources for this project are from [FAOSTAT crops and livestock products](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL), [FAOSTAT Food Security and Nutrition Indicators](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FS), and a (Global Dataset)[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01150-7] builtfrom 202 studies published between 1984 and 2020. FAO is the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and is a specialized agency of the United Nations that leads international efforts to defeat hunger. They collect their data from national statistical agencies, international organizations, and other sources via Questionnaires. This data is widely used in the field of agriculture and food security, and is a reliable source of data for our project. The Global Dataset is conctructed and used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an intergovernmental body that provides the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic consequences. The IPCC is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change, and is a also a reliable source of data for our project. We generated our data by selecting columns relevant to our analysis, and joining the data on `Country`.
